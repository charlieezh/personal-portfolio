        <h2 class="act-title">Campus Involvements</h2>
        <button class="collapsible">Michigan Venture Club</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Since January 2023, I have been serving as a Research Analyst on the AI and Web3 teams. My role involves conducting thorough industry research and marketing analysis within the AI team at a generative AI company named Cogno. This includes benchmarking competitors and studying user needs and pain points to advance the company's strategic goals. Additionally, I have taken the initiative to coordinate the development of College DAO, which stands as the first and largest student-led community focused on connecting and providing blockchain education and opportunities to campuses worldwide.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Residential College Program (RC)</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Since January 2023, I have had the honor of being selected as one of 18 students across the entire Residential College (RC) program, a nomination I received from Theresa Braunschneider, the head of the U-M First-Year Seminar Program. In this role as an Ambassador, I have actively participated in recruitment efforts for the college. I engage with over 300 prospective RC students to assist with UM Admissions and the LSA Admissions/Michigan Learning Communities, guiding them through the process. Additionally, I contribute to the RC experience by managing RC social media platforms and authoring student blog posts that highlight our community, which are published on the RC or LSA website.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Blockchain at Michigan</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>As a Cohort Member since January 2023, I have been focused on advancing my understanding of both the technical and business aspects of blockchain technology. This comprehensive development has enabled me to not only grasp the complexities of the technology itself but also to recognize its potential applications in the business domain. I have applied this knowledge by creating and developing blockchain projects tailored to fit relevant business contexts. Through these projects, I've sought out and identified specific market niches where the integration of blockchain could prove to be exceptionally beneficial and value-adding.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Michigan Hackers</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Since January 2023, as a core member of the Web Team, my journey has been centered around both learning and honing my web development skills. Each week, I work on a new project, with each project's theme and scope directly influenced by the specific topic or content I've learned during that period. This approach allows me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, thereby solidifying my learning through real-world application.</p>
</div>
        <h2 class="act-title">Project Experience</h2>
        <button class="collapsible">Insta485 Website Generator</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This program leverages Python, HTML, and CSS to process HTML templates, JSON data, and other miscellaneous inputs to generate static websites. Further, I have developed server-side interactive pages that interface with a SQL database, supporting dynamic page content, CRUD operations, and session management. Additionally, I have created a client-side application in JavaScript capable of operating within a web browser. This application performs AJAX calls to communicate with a REST API, enabling a seamless user experience without page reloads.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Zookeeper</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I calculated a Minimum Spanning Tree to identify the subset of edges that ensures all locations in the zoo are connected at the lowest possible weight cost. Additionally, I implemented the Branch and Bound Algorithm, a method used to calculate the weight of an optimal solution to the Travelling Salesperson Problem, ensuring the most efficient route is found for traversing through the different locations within the zoo.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Euchre Game</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I designed and built a C++ program that simulates Euchre, a popular card game in Michigan. The program's structure is organized using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) across different files: Pact, Card, Player, and the driver file Euchre, to manage the complexities of the game logic. Leveraging the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, I used Derived Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to create two distinct player types: an AI player that operates autonomously and a human-controlled player, each with unique playing strategies. These implementations facilitate a dynamic gaming experience that closely mimics the real-life interactions of Euchre players.</p>
